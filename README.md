Python Code Compressor
**(Compresses Python Codes by ";" Character)**
----------

Disclaimer : This is an stupid code, wont work for most cases, but its a good idea to build something like this.





### Usage :

`Download` or `Clone` the repo

`cd` into its directory 

then run the compressor : `python compressor.py Path [Option] [Options data]`

example of useage : `py python compressor.py sample.py`

#### Options :
**-t , --text** : Used to supply a string of text to the compressor : `py compressor.py -t hello world!`

**-f , --file** : Used to supply a file path of text to the compressor : `py compressor.py -f sample.py`


by default after compression, it will be outputed to the terminal, for writing the output into a text file, you can use the `>` operator (for windows machine's)

example : `python compressor.py sample.py > compressed.py`
